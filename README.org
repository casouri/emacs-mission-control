#+TITLE: Misson control

This package provides a macOS mission-control-like way to switch between buffers.

*mission control:*

=mcon-swith= to open preview panel, use number to select buffer to switch to.

[[./mcon.gif][./mcon.gif]]

*C TAB:* 

Press mcon-c-tab (C-S-tab on terminal) (=mcon-c-tab-graphic=) to open preview panel, mcon-c-tab (C-S-tab) to loop through them.
After =mcon-c-tab-timeout= seconds of idle buffer will switch to the selected one.
