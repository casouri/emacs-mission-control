;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; Mission-control provides you with a way to switch between buffers like
;; switching windows in macOS mission control.

;; It also provides a C-TAB feature to switch between buffers like the command tab
;; in macOS.

;; To use mission-control: simply invoke `mcon-switch'.

;; To use mission-control-c-tab: configure `mcon-c-tab-key-list'
;; and invoke `mcon-c-tab-setup-binding' to bind keys.
;; Then use that keybinding to switch between buffers.
